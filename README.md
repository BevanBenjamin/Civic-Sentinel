# Civic-Sentinel
CivicSentinel is a digital feedback and sentiment analysis platform that empowers citizens to express their experience with key public services at a granular, location-based level.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Across towns and cities, residents often experience issues with basic services like electricity outages, inconsistent water supply, and irregular garbage collection. These problems usually go unreported, or worse — unheard, especially when feedback is buried in silos or lacks structured data.
We complain about these problems to neighbors, on WhatsApp groups, or sometimes just ignore them — because even if we want to speak up, there’s no place where our voice actually counts.
Meanwhile, government officials face a different challenge — they want to improve services, but they often lack real-time, ground-level feedback from the people they serve.
We need a bridge — a way for households to share what’s working and what’s not — and for local authorities to see, at a glance, where attention is needed.

SOLUTION:
CivicSentinel is a digital feedback and sentiment analysis platform that empowers citizens to express their experience with key public services at a granular, location-based level. It enables feedback collection for the following categories:
Electricity
Water Supply
Garbage Collection
Road Conditions
Streetlight Functionality
	i) Citizen-Facing Interface:
Users select the relevant service category.
They enter their city, area/street, and optionally, house number.
A star rating (1 to 5) is given based on their satisfaction level.
They submit a brief review or remark highlighting their issue or appreciation. –no login, no hassle.
	ii ) For Officials:
Government officials receive a real-time dashboard.
Aggregated service ratings are displayed area-wise and service-wise.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques extract sentiment and summarize frequent complaints or keywords.
Visual insights enable quick identification of low-performing regions or recurring issues.
This solution brings together structured citizen engagement and data-driven decision-making to improve the quality of municipal service delivery.
